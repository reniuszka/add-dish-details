Description:

The app is built with React18 and https://umzzcc503l.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dishes/
I added axios to POST data, thanks to that I do not have any CORS errors

My STEPS (libraries used):

1. npm create vite@latest (React)
2. npm i axios

Your steps if you would like to download my code:

1. Node version ( node --version => v16+). Vite requires Node.js version 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
2. npm version 8+
3. Download the files and follow the steps:
   - cd dish-details (or the name of the folder where the files are saved)
   - npm install (to install node modules)
   - npm run dev (to run the project)
   - open it in the browser (example: http://127.0.0.1:5173/)
